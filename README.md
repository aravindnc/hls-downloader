## Backstory

I noticed that there were fewer browser-based tools available for downloading video streams that use the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) protocol, so I saw an opportunity to fill this gap and set out to create a website that would allow users to easily download HLS streams for offline viewing or archival purposes inside from their browser and purely client side.

## Demo

Try it now [from here](https://hlsdownloader.thetuhin.com/). Please note it only supports [these browsers](https://caniuse.com/sharedarraybuffer).

## Roadmap

- [ ] Support DASH Protocol
- [x] Custom header Support
